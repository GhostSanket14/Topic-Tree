                "cardDesc": "Forts in India stand as majestic witnesses to the subcontinent’s rich and diverse history, spanning from the ancient Mauryan Empire to the valiant Maratha reign. These monumental structures were more than just military bastions — they served as centers of administration, trade, culture, and resistance. The Mauryas laid early foundations of fort architecture, emphasizing strategic location and defense. This legacy evolved through the Rajput hill forts of Rajasthan, the grand citadels of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, and culminated in the robust, hill-clinging forts of the Marathas, designed for guerrilla warfare. Each fort tells a unique story through its ramparts, bastions, and gateways — stories of valor, empire, resistance, and architectural brilliance that define India’s historical landscape.",
